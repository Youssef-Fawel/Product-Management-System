Product Management System

This project is a simple Product Management System built using Node.js and Vanilla JavaScript,
allowing users to add, view, update, and delete products through a web interface.
The data is stored in a JSON file, providing a straightforward approach to managing product information.

Technologies Used:

Node.js: For creating the server and handling HTTP requests.

HTML/CSS: For building the user interface and styling the application
.
JavaScript: For dynamic functionality, including form submissions, product filtering, and updating the product list without refreshing the page.

JSON: For storing product data persistently in a file.
